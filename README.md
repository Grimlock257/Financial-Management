# Introduction
This is my coursework for term 2 year 1 programming module at university.

# Running the program
1. Open IDE of choice
2. Create new empty project
3. Clone repository/Financial folder to your project
4. Run `Main.cpp`

# What is it?
The module was programming with C++ and we had to create a project that used C++.

# My Solution
## Original plan
Originally, my program was going to be a self financial management application where users could create various types of accounts through the application (such as current account, savings account etc.) and mark down their expenses to keep track of them of them.

There was also going to be a mortgage and saving interest calculator and you would have been able to open either types of account.

## The issue...
I lost my project! I had to redo the project last minute which meant some of my previously implemented features didn't make it into the final solution uploaded here at the moment, such as exporting mortgage repayment data to a CSV file. Also, some of the code is a bit messy and not implemented at it's based and experiences code duplication which could quite easily be made into functions but never got round to it before the deadline!

Maybe this will teach me to use GitHub and make sure my backup methods work!
